Remember, all of the processing work can easily be done at your desk or right at your kitchen table! IMPORTANT\nWe do provide you with the actual pamphlet that you will be processing which is a sales pamphlet for our Credit Repair Manual.

And since the demand for our Credit Repair Manual is so OVERWHELMING, you will have the opportunity to process as many pamphlets as your schedule can handle ! You can process 100...500...1,000 or even 1,500 pamphlets per week, week after week, month after month, year after year ... for as long as you wish to participate ! HOW MUCH MONEY CAN YOU EARN?

Processing payments and additional processing materials will continue to arrive at your home, dorm or apartment for as long as you wish to continue participating in the program! That's right, you can always have money coming in week after week because processing payments and additional processing materials will continue to arrive at your home, dorm or apartment for as long as you wish to participate!

         "The Scotsman\n\n Thu 22 Aug 2002 \n\n Meaningful sentences \n \n Tracey Lawson \n \n \n If you ever wanted to look like \"one of the most dangerous inmates in prison\n history\", as one judge described Charles Bronson, nows your chance. Bronson -\n the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and\n fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary\n muscle power. \n \n Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48,\n has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he\n has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a\n day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at\n virtually no cost. \n \n The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a\n fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and\n starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the\n exercise industry. \n \n \"I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it,\" is the\n opening paragraph penned by Bronson. \"Its a joke and a big con and they call\n me a criminal!\" You cant help feeling he has a point. \n \n This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having\n already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems\n created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to\n discover creative expression while residing at Her Majestys pleasure. \n \n Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents\n when he was sent to Barlinnie Prisons famous special unit, which aimed to\n help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to\n express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the\n murder of \"Babs\" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he\n has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was\n published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an\n award-winning film. \n \n Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in\n Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison\n officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being\n transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and\n developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer,\n a frank account of Glasgows criminal culture in the 1960s, which received\n critical praise. \n \n And Lord Archer doesnt seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books\n that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book\n deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported £10 million, and is no doubt\n scribbling away as we speak. \n \n So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so\n destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck\n on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronsons publisher, has published many books\n about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both\n pragmatic and profound. \n \n He says: \"Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have\n known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the\n chance to focus on their creative skills. \n \n \"It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an\n education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time\n anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents.\" \n \n However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says:\n \"Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine\n the very essence of who they are. \n \n \"They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or\n am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something\n good?\" \n \n Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that\n of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered\n mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed\n robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term\n over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was\n jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly\n two days during a jail siege. \n \n Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is\n renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands\n and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: \"I can hit\n a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds.\" \n \n But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary\n Fitness might be the book which will see Bronsons face sitting on every\n coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which\n so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because\n Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. \n \n \"All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, its just a load of\n bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket,\" he writes, in what can only be\n described as a refreshingly honest style. \"We can all be fat lazy bastards,\n its our choice, Im sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff\n your face with shit you become shit, thats logical to me.\" \n \n As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside\n we all needed. \n \n \n Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will\n be available in bookstores from October at £7.99\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

At shopping \nmalls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front \nstoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in \npublic office. While chances are high that we won't know them \npersonally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and \nask for our votes.\n\nJust as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it \nhas begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.\n\nIn this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State \nBill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail \naddresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent \neach an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.\n\nThat day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more \nexpensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio \nspots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of \n35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.\n\nHad Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have \nbeen equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters \nwould have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones \nthrough any of those channels.\n\nThe response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He \nwas lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost \nentirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been \nrefined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice \n``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.\n\nHis detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but \nbecause the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign \nmay have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money \nin politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication \nmediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.\n\nNo one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be \nhighly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, \nit's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different \nunsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.\n\nThe debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress \nthat would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We \nbelieve e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or \nTV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A \nsimple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of \nfuture mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be \ntaken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.\n\nWhen a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the \nInternet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them \nto perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 \npercent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail \naccounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.\n\nCandidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the \nJones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better \nensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient \ngroups.\n\nBut the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter \nan e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without \nopening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage \nthe sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam \nadvocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. \nPolitical candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best \nthey can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an \nadvocacy management and communications software company. Larry Purpuro, \nthe former Republican National Committee deputy chief of staff, is \nfounder and president of a political e-marketing firm.

His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field. No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters. The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads. When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium. Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient groups. But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an advocacy management and communications software company.

They can't fob you off with 'that's a software\nproblem, talk to the software vendor.' etc. If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There\nis then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,\nthough some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore. You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,\nwho do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,\nthat has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a\ncheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.

Rolf Eden, 72, a Berlin disco owner famous for his countless sex partners, said he could imagine no better way to die than in the arms of an attractive young woman - preferably under 30. \"I put it all in my last will and testament - the last woman who sleeps with me gets all the money,\" Mr Eden told Bild newspaper. \"I want to pass away in the most beautiful moment of my life. First a lot of fun with a beautiful woman, then wild sex, a final orgasm - and it will all end with a heart attack and then Im gone.\" Mr Eden, who is selling his nightclub this year, said applications should be sent in quickly because of his age. \"It could end very soon,\" he said. ------------------------ Yahoo!

         null,
         "The Scotsman Thu 22 Aug 2002 Meaningful sentences Tracey Lawson If you ever wanted to look like \"one of the most dangerous inmates in prison history\", as one judge described Charles Bronson, nows your chance. Bronson - the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary muscle power. Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48, has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at virtually no cost. The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the exercise industry. \"I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it,\" is the opening paragraph penned by Bronson. \"Its a joke and a big con and they call me a criminal!\" You cant help feeling he has a point. This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to discover creative expression while residing at Her Majestys pleasure. Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents when he was sent to Barlinnie Prisons famous special unit, which aimed to help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the murder of \"Babs\" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an award-winning film. Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer, a frank account of Glasgows criminal culture in the 1960s, which received critical praise. And Lord Archer doesnt seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported £10 million, and is no doubt scribbling away as we speak. So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronsons publisher, has published many books about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both pragmatic and profound. He says: \"Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the chance to focus on their creative skills. \"It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents.\" However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says: \"Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine the very essence of who they are. \"They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something good?\" Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly two days during a jail siege. Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: \"I can hit a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds.\" But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary Fitness might be the book which will see Bronsons face sitting on every coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. \"All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, its just a load of bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket,\" he writes, in what can only be described as a refreshingly honest style. \"We can all be fat lazy bastards, its our choice, Im sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff your face with shit you become shit, thats logical to me.\" As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside we all needed. Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will be available in bookstores from October at £7.99 ------------------------ Yahoo!

At shopping malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in public office. While chances are high that we won't know them personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and ask for our votes. Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters. In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support. That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium. Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones through any of those channels. The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice ``paid for'' disclaimer in the message. His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field. No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters. The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads. When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium. Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient groups. But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an advocacy management and communications software company.

Bush proclaimed, \"The problem with\nthe French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.\" Origins: Yet another French fried \"George W. Bush is dumb\"\nstory has been taken up by those who like their caricatures\ndrawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that\nemerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,\nBritain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President\nJacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,\nthe decline of the French economy. \"The problem with the\nFrench,\" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, \"is that they don't\nhave a word for entrepreneur.\" The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness\nWilliams of Crosby, who claimed \"my good friend Tony Blair\" had\nrecently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton. Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness\nWilliams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did\nreceive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of\ncommunications and strategy. \"I can tell you that the prime\nminister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly\nnever told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,\"\nCampbell told The Post. \"If she put this in a speech, it must\nhave been a joke.\" This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of\na jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than\nstellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories\ntoo hard, we can come up with three other instances we've\nchronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the\nmoment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the\nranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged\nas the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the\nintelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus\nquatrain which pontificated that the \"village idiot\" would win\nthe 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it\nwas the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks\nto chortling up their sleeves. Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual\nshortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they\nseemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this\npublic figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever\nbeen. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at\nsome level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always\nfall upon appreciative ears.

Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard\ndisk\nfor Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which\nwent\nfine except it didn't pick up my monitor. I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15\" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia\nGeForce4\nTi4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's\ndefault\nset. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using\nRPM.\nThen I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net),\nbut\nit still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next? Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock\ntwice,\nthe whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch\nis\ninactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead. If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -\nI've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas. Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?\nOpinions\nwelcome.

If Habeas is going to die just because SA does not\nsupport it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that is\nnobody's problem but Habeas's.

This is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in all\nits incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject\nat SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).

If the Habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in non-spam,\nand effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g.,\nSA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then\nspammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue. There's nobody\nleft to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their\nwill because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark. Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to\nmake all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose\nfor which it was designed. Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against\nreal spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops,\nthen either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights\nto use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've both\ncreated and monopolized a market for \"internet postage stamps\" that\neverybody has to pay them for. The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do\nabsolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with\nlawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly\nfrom everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for the\nprivilege of policing their trademark for them. I don't believe they'll\never get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it.

We earned PRECISELY $26,087.58 in our first 94 days doing JUST that - and we scanned our checks online for you to see them with your own eyes!  We've TWEAKED things a little because WE DON'T WANT you to talk to ANYONE.  WE WANT to talk to people FOR YOU.\n\nif you are ....\nVERY BUSY or,\nAren't GOOD AT TALKING TO PEOPLE or,\nDON'T WANT to talk to people....\n\nThen let US work FULL TIME for you.

Grand Total = $555,550.00���� NUMBERS DO NOT LIE.� GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND���� FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND ���� NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL���� STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!----------------------------------------------------------------------���� REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10���� PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 PEOPLE YOU MAILED.Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone,or 1/2, or even 1/5 of those people mailed 100,000 e-mailseach or more?� There are over 250 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting.� Believe me, many peoplewill do just that, and more!���� METHOD #2:� PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET��� ---------------------------------------------------------------------Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and thereare hundreds of FREE places to advertise.� Placing a lot offree ads on the internet will easily get a larger response.We strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add METHOD# 2 as you go along.For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered.� That's it!� Always provide same dayservice on all orders.� This will guarantee that the e-mailsthey send out, with your name and address on it, will beprompt because they can not advertise until they receive thereport.���� ORDER EACH REPORT BY IT NUMBER & NAME ONLY.Note:� Always send $5 cash (US Currency) for each report.Checks are NOT accepted.� Make sure the cash is wrapped inat lease 2 sheets of paper before you put it in the envelope.On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER and the NAMEof the Report you are ordering, your email ADDRESS, your NAMEand postal address.� Make sure you affix the proper 'International'Postage if ordering a report from outside your country.���� PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:-------------------------------------------------------------------------Report #1:� The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the NetOrder Report #1 from:K.J.

Corporation and I makepretty good money.� When I received this program I grumbledto Jody about receiving \"junk mail\".� I made fun of thewhole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population andpercentages involved.� I \"knew\" it wouldn't work.� Jodytotally ignored my supposed intelligence and a few days latershe jumped in with both feet.� I made merciless fun of her,and was ready to lay the old \"I told you so\" on her whenthe thing didn't work.� Well, the laugh was on me!� Within3 weeks she had received 50 responses.� Within the next 45days she had received a total of $147,200.00 all cash!I was shocked.� I have joined Jody in her \"hobby\".���� Mitchell Wof,� Chicago, Illinois----------------------------------------------------------------\"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks tomake up my mind to participate in this plan.� But conservativethat I am, I decided that the initial investment was so littlethat there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough ordersto at least get my money back.� I was surprised when I foundmy medium sized post office box crammed with orders.� I made$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks.� The nice thing about thisdeal is that it does not matter where people live.� Theresimply isn't a better investment with a faster return andso big\".���� Dan Sondstrom,� Alberta, Canada---------------------------------------------------------------\"I had received this program before.� I deleted it, but laterI wondered if I should hav given it a try.� Of course, Ihad no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had towait until I was e-mailed again by someone else . . . . . . . 11 months passed then it luckily came again.� I did not delete this one!� I made more than $490,000 on my first tryand all the money came within 22 weeks\".���� Susan De Suza,�� New York, NY--------------------------------------------------------------\"It really is a great opportunity to

The pre-addressed, postage paid envelopes will be sent directly to your home, dorm or apartment. You simply fold the pamphlets, insert them in the envelopes and send them right out ! Remember, all of the processing work can easily be done at your desk or right at your kitchen table! IMPORTANT\nWe do provide you with the actual pamphlet that you will be processing which is a sales pamphlet for our Credit Repair Manual. Our Credit Repair Manual is a best-selling financial product that many people are ordering and using to legally clear up their negative credit. And since the demand for our Credit Repair Manual is so OVERWHELMING, you will have the opportunity to process as many pamphlets as your schedule can handle ! You can process 100...500...1,000 or even 1,500 pamphlets per week, week after week, month after month, year after year ... for as long as you wish to participate ! HOW MUCH MONEY CAN YOU EARN?

If you process 1,000 pamphlets you will receive a full $1,000.00... if you process 1,500 pamphlets you will receive a full $1,500.00... Etc ! What's even better about our program is that you NEVER have to worry about the sale of our Credit Repair Manual in order to receive your $1.00 per pamphlet. Our program DOES NOT WORK ON COMMISSION! You will receive a FULL $1.00 for each and every pamphlet that you process REGARDLESS if any sales are made!

Processing payments and additional processing materials will continue to arrive at your home, dorm or apartment for as long as you wish to continue participating in the program! That's right, you can always have money coming in week after week because processing payments and additional processing materials will continue to arrive at your home, dorm or apartment for as long as you wish to participate!

Plus, our program is especially beneficial for people who need to earn a serious extra income but might not have the spare time for a second job. As stated, just a few hours per day could possibly earn you well over $500.00 per week... NO JOKE!

FACT\nPractically every type of person can benefit financially from our Pamphlet Processing Program. IMPORTANT LEGAL INFORMATION The information contained in our Credit Repair Manual is 100% Legal and Legitimate! In fact, there are hundreds of lawyers and attorneys all over the country using this valuable information and charging people big money to remove negative and incorrect items from their credit files! However, our Credit Repair Manual explains how people can do the VERY SAME THING that these costly attorneys are doing except our credit repair manual shows people how to repair their credit FAST, EASY and for FREE without having to hire an attorney !

This manual is included for becoming a member of our Pamphlet Processing Program ! Therefore, to get started immediately, all that our company requires is a one-time refundable order-processing fee of only $45. Please understand, we cannot afford to send out a package of valuable materials to everyone interested in our program.

We must charge a small processing fee to ensure that only serious individuals intend to participate in our program. Keep in mind, you NEVER have to pay us any other fees and you can participate for as long as you wish! This fee simply assures our company that you are indeed serious about our program and the opportunity to make good money working from your home.

Dear Friends, The online content business is doing fantastic.\nSound crazy? Perhaps. With advertising, online and off, taking it on the chin\nfor the past two years, online content sites have been shutting down, laying\noff staff and pulling back on their offerings.\nHowever, this horrible environment\nhas resulted in an undeniable trend: content businesses are challenging\npeople to pay for content. Finally, after five years of free, people are beginning to understand that online, as in the real\nworld, you get what you pay for and they are taking out their credit cards. U.S. consumers spent $675 million on paid online content last\nyear, a 92 percent increase over 2000 spending levels, according to Online\nPublishers Association, and that figure is expected to increase exponentially\nthis year. Look at these success stories: New York Times Digital has been steadily increasing its paid content services over the last year, and registered a 16 percent increase in its total revenues for the latest quarter. TheStreet.com brought over $3 million in subscriptions last quarter, an increase of almost 50 percent over the year-ago quarter. ConsumerReports.com will reach over a million paying subscribers by the end of this year. RealNetworks' consumer multi-media subscription service has more than 750,000 subscribers, bringing in $17.8 million in the last quarter. The Wall Street Journal Online\nadded over 6,000 new paying customers last quarter, bringing its subscriber\nbase to 646,000. FT.com has signed up 17,000 subscribers in three months since it launched its premium site in May. In recognition of this trend we're hosting the third installation of our innovative Content Management Summit on October 10, 2002. The event charts the changes in the content industry from free to paid subscription services, and the technologies that are enabling the management and monetizing of content.\nOur previous Content Management Summit (aka Digital Rights Summit) on October 18 last year in New York City and January 29 in Los Angeles were unqualified successes.\nThe Content Management Summit III, taking place in New York at the Millennium Broadway on October 10, 2002, will bring together the 100 executives from the leading content and distribution firms for a focused day of networking and discovering practical solutions.\nThe event will feature presentations from software and services companies providing services\nand solutions for selling, distributing, managing, and protecting content.\nWe're thrilled that Microsoft, TeleKnowledge, eMeta, and Liquify will all be demonstrating their latest products and services.\nThe event will also feature six intimate round tables focusing on various aspects of online content. These panels are meant to provide an informal forum to discuss the challenges\nfacing these specific vertical markets, the changes in the sectors since\nthe dot-com downfall, and best practices in the industry. The panels will\nfeature leading practitioners in each sector, and will also include an interactive\nquestion and answer session with the audience.\nAmong the round table topics will be: Weblogs: how they are affecting big media companies, editorially as well as in content delivery/production mechanisms. Financial news and information companies: how they are using technologies to deliver content to users, and how the economics have changed since the stock market downfall. Business information services such as Hoovers, Lexis-Nexis and others: best practices in the industry, niche product launches and revenue streams. Daily news/newspaper companies publishing online: how speed dictates technology choices, and the move towards\npaid content and its implications, among other issues. Consumer and entertainment publishers: how do publishers determine the value of entertainment content, the push towards paid subscriptions, online advertising and other issues.

In \nlate 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to \nco-found PayPal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens \nof millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier Internet \ntransaction processor. Now online auction house eBay has acquired his \ncompany for a king's ransom.\n\nNot bad for a 27-year-old kid from Ukraine.\n\nA programmer since he was 10 years old, Levchin and his family moved to \nChicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a \nmission. He created a startup right out of college to build secure \npasswords for Palm Pilots. He met Peter Thiel, and the two founded \nPayPal to target online payment security. Thiel is now CEO of the \ncompany.\n\n\"This company was founded on the notion of security value,\" Levchin \nsays. \"Peter Thiel and I shared that vision from the very beginning.\"\n\nThiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas Levchin remains \nfocused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good \nfortune.\n\n\"I explain [PayPal] as a security company posing as a transaction \nprocessor,\" Levchin says. \"We spend a lot of time designing security so \nit doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. \nThe trade-off is fundamental.\"\n\nMountain View, Calif.-based PayPal allows businesses and consumers with \ne-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the Internet, \naccepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. The \nservice extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and \nmore than 3 million business accounts.\n\nMost of PayPal's users are participants in online auctions, which led \nPayPal to be closely linked with eBay, the leading Web auction site. \nAlthough they were once rivals, the relationship between the two \ncompanies resulted July 8 in eBay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition \nof PayPal.

In late 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to co-found PayPal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens of millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier Internet transaction processor. Now online auction house eBay has acquired his company for a king's ransom. Not bad for a 27-year-old kid from Ukraine. A programmer since he was 10 years old, Levchin and his family moved to Chicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a mission. He created a startup right out of college to build secure passwords for Palm Pilots. He met Peter Thiel, and the two founded PayPal to target online payment security. Thiel is now CEO of the company. \"This company was founded on the notion of security value,\" Levchin says. \"Peter Thiel and I shared that vision from the very beginning.\" Thiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas Levchin remains focused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good fortune. \"I explain [PayPal] as a security company posing as a transaction processor,\" Levchin says. \"We spend a lot of time designing security so it doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. The trade-off is fundamental.\" Mountain View, Calif.-based PayPal allows businesses and consumers with e-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the Internet, accepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. The service extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and more than 3 million business accounts. Most of PayPal's users are participants in online auctions, which led PayPal to be closely linked with eBay, the leading Web auction site. Although they were once rivals, the relationship between the two companies resulted July 8 in eBay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition of PayPal. The agreement is subject to regulatory review. Levchin says he will stay at PayPal as it merges with eBay. \"There are areas of synergy and collaboration we can explore.\" Although security is a dominant feature for PayPal, the company's ability to carry out open communications among the millions of participants fits the growing Web services model, Levchin says. \"This is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to one another,\" he says. Levchin is a panelist at InfoWorld's Next-Generation Web Services II conference Sept. 20 PayPal, as an online payment system, is a natural target for fraud. And Levchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on exploiting the system, says Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst covering financial services at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner. \"If they didn't have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up,\" Litan says. To combat criminals, Levchin established \"Igor,\" an antifraud program that monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts. Levchin says building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes. \"The work I do is important to PayPal and to consumers in general because the work makes Internet shopping safe. It's the view that ecommerce has arrived.\" ",

If we could get this and the alsa driver stuff working, it would be whole lot easier to try out a newer kernel ... but then the size of these rpms are huge, at least for us n^1 world courties ... ;-{ ...

In a related irony, today was \"Disney Day\" at Borders[5], where they played Disney rock songs with the volume turned up too loud, disturbing my usual habit of reading a book there. However, I did manage to skim through _The Practice of Programming_. In an unrelated note, if you haven't been electrocuted by a Model T spark plug, I highly recommend it.

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. \nOn January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch.\nUpon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. \nOn further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. \nAccording to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.\n I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. \nThis is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses. \nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address. \nUpon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.\n Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest. \nThanks and Regards,\n MR.VINCENT NNAJI.\n\n\n\n",
